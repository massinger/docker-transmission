This image contains an instance of [Transmission client](https://www.transmissionbt.com/).
This project was inspired from [this project](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-transmission) and rewrited to provide most of the configuration with ENV variables.

:warning: Take care of the [changelogs](CHANGELOG.md) because some breaking changes may happend between versions.

# Features

## Securing the webui with a username/password.

this requires 3 settings to be changed in the settings.json file.

Make sure the container is stopped before editing these settings.

`"rpc-authentication-required": true,` - check this, the default is false, change to true.

`"rpc-username": "transmission",` substitute transmission for your chosen user name, this is just an example.

`rpc-password` will be a hash starting with {, replace everything including the { with your chosen password, keeping the quotes.

Transmission will convert it to a hash when you restart the container after making the above edits.

## Updating Blocklists Automatically

You can configure an external cron job to update automatically the blocklists.
This requires `"blocklist-enabled": true,` to be set. By setting this to true, it is assumed you have also populated `blocklist-url` with a valid block list.

The automatic update is a shell script that downloads a blocklist from the url stored in the settings.json, gunzips it, and restarts the transmission daemon.

```
0 3 * * * root docker ps | grep --quiet 'transmission$' && docker exec --user transmission transmission /opt/transmission/blocklist-update.sh
```


## Notification by mail for done torrents

A notification script is included into this container. This script is run each times a Torrent has finished to be downloaded. By default it is able to send a mail but you can edit it to make something else.
You can activate in by simply configure at least the following environment variables into your container

| Name of the value  | Type              | Description                                                  |
